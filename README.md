# RefineGAN

Implementation of RefineGAN from the paper: ["Refinegan: Universally generating waveform better than ground truth with highly accurate pitch and intensity responses"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00962), 2021

To achieve the following two goals:
- Generate the speech template (f0 + log-mel) from an audio file (any random file works)
- Implement the forward function of the RefineGAN generator
